The previous AI engineer initiated development of an NFT Battle Arena application, starting with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Initially, the focus was on a feature-rich single-page application following specific UI/UX guidelines (), incorporating multi-language support, an NFT marketplace with a countdown, a battle simulation demo, animated emojis, Telegram integration, and SEO. A parsing error in  was identified and fixed, successfully launching the frontend.

Following this, the user requested a complete redesign to an iOS 18 dark glass UI style, emphasizing glassmorphism, rounded elements, minimalism, smooth micro-animations, structured translations (JSON), and robust mobile adaptation. The AI engineer successfully implemented this redesign by updating core CSS, Tailwind config, translation systems, and various React components, achieving the new aesthetic.

The most recent task involves creating an *exact static copy* of the redesigned site, splitting it into  (structure),  (all styles), and  (all functionality). The AI engineer has just started this task by creating the  file in the  directory, signaling a shift to a traditional web development approach for this specific deliverable.

<product_requirements>
The user is building a full-stack NFT Battle Arena application, starting from scratch. The application needs to be a full-fledged website, not just a landing page, and must be conversion-optimized and agency-quality.

**Initial Requirements (Phase 1):**
*   **Core Features:** Multi-language support (Ukrainian, English, Spanish, Polish, Russian), NFT marketplace (unavailable initially with a 5-month countdown timer), interactive battle simulation demo, game information page (instructions, gallery).
*   **NFT Marketplace Details:** Ability to connect Telegram account, list NFTs/accessories, search, change prices, categories, shopping cart, and NFT cards with price/description.
*   **Battle Simulation Details:** A provided  module and associated CSS styles for a view-only battle demo.
*   **Design & UI/UX:** Use  components, incorporate glass-morphism effects, z-index hierarchy, visually distinct CTA sections, stylish accordions, emotional impact, and intuitive navigation. Initially, follow  design guidelines (dark theme, #00FFD1 accent, sharp-edge buttons, grid layout, animated emojis).
*   **Technical:** Telegram Bot API integration, SEO optimization (meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD), responsive design.

**Redesign Requirements (Phase 2):**
*   **New Design Style:** Complete redesign to iOS 18 dark glass UI style.
*   **Aesthetics:** Dark glassmorphism with soft blur for cards/blocks, rounded elements (border-radius: 2xl), clear contrast (white/grey text), minimalism.
*   **Animations:** Remove all animated emojis, retain only smooth micro-animations (hover, fade-in).
*   **Multilingual:** Ensure stable Telegram WebApp connection, all text translated via JSON files (en/pl/ua).
*   **Mobile Adaptation:** 100% responsive, adaptive grid/flex, large buttons for tapping, vertical sections for large blocks.
*   **Technical:** Correct style loading without overlays, Apple system font.

**Current Request (Phase 3):**
*   **Static Site Copy:** Create an exact copy of the current redesigned site (design, functionality, texts, styles, effects, logic) broken down into three separate files:
    *   : Pure HTML structure.
    *   : All CSS styles, including responsive design and hamburger menu.
    *   : All interactive functionality (menu, Telegram, language switching).
*   **Key Constraint:** No changes to the existing functionality or appearance; it must be a precise replica.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI Framework:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
- **Styling Paradigms:** Uix-labs dark theme, Glassmorphism, iOS 18 dark glass UI.
- **Internationalization:** Context API for translations, JSON for language files.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM.
- **API Integration:** Axios for frontend, Python  for backend.
- **External Integrations:** Telegram WebApp API (mocked).
- **3D Graphics:** Spline (mentioned in guidelines, but not explicitly implemented yet).
- **Utility:** ,  for class management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**High-Level Architecture:**
*   **Frontend ():** React application, uses Vite (implied by  config and modern React setup), Styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. Manages routing, state, and API calls.
*   **Backend ():** FastAPI application, handles API endpoints, database interactions with MongoDB.
*   **Database:** MongoDB, accessed by the backend via  (async client).

**Detailed Directory Structure (Relevant Frontend):**

**Key Files and Changes:**
*   : Initialized with basic routing for  and integrates . Later updated to include , , and  for , , , and  components, along with  and .
*   : Critical for defining global styles, Tailwind CSS  directives, and custom CSS variables for the  and later the iOS 18 dark glass UI themes (e.g., , , ). This file also includes font definitions.
*   : Configures Tailwind CSS, specifically extending  to include  and customizing the color palette to match the design guidelines.
*   : Created to manage the loading and context for multi-language support, reading JSON files from .
*   : New files (, , ) created to store all application translations.
*   : Created for the site's header navigation, including the . Updated to reflect  and then iOS 18 dark glass UI styles and hamburger menu for mobile.
*   : Implemented the main landing page content, including hero sections, animated emojis (later removed/minimized), and statistics. Updated to conform to iOS 18 design.
*   : Integrated the  logic and UI for the battle simulation, updated with the new design.
*   : Built the NFT marketplace UI, including a countdown timer, mock Telegram connect, search, filters, and NFT card display. Corrected a parsing error () by wrapping conditions in . Updated to iOS 18 design.
*   : Implemented the game information, roadmap, and FAQ sections. Updated to iOS 18 design.
*   : Initially a standard React entry point. Most recently, it has been created as the first step towards generating a *static* version of the site, containing only the HTML structure.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the creation of the static site copy by generating  (for all styles) and  (for all functionality) based on the current React application's rendered output.
- Ensure the static copy is an exact replica of the current iOS 18 Dark Glass UI design and functionality, including mobile responsiveness and hamburger menu logic.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with creating an *exact copy* of the current NFT Battle Arena site (which has an iOS 18 Dark Glass UI style) and splitting it into three separate files: , , and . This is a significant shift from the existing React single-page application structure towards a traditional static web development approach for this specific deliverable.

The AI engineer has successfully completed the first part of this task:

*   **Created :** This file is intended to hold the complete HTML structure of the site, free from any React components or JavaScript logic. Its creation signifies the initial step in deconstructing the current React application's visual and structural output into a purely static HTML document, as requested by the user.

The work is currently in progress. The AI engineer has yet to extract all styling into  and all interactive logic into  to complete this specific user request for a static, tripartite version of the application.
